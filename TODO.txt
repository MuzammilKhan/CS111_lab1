Points to address:
-once we know if simple or subshell consider redirection -- also figure out where to do this //in read-command.c
-is the way comments are being removed correct
-need to write function to properly delete the command tree
-turn && into * and || into $. Check for * and $ chars first and report invalid synatax before replacing them in buffer

-place this pseudo-code somewhere:
if b == operator: newline = space
elif b == "(": newline = space
elif b == ")": newline = ";"
else b == word: newline = ";"

-'\t' is also whitespace and can seperate words. code has to be modified to accomodate  this.
- other whitespace associated errors ex: line starting with whitespace will mess with substring detection as it stands currently.
-I/O pointers
