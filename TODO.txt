Points to address:
-is the way comments are being removed correct
-need to write function to properly delete the command tree
-Check for * and $ chars first and report invalid synatax before replacing them in buffer


-'\t' is also whitespace and can seperate words. code has to be modified to accomodate  this.
- other whitespace associated errors ex: line starting with whitespace will mess with substring detection as it stands currently.
-I/O pointers
- address this "Note that this does not apply for the case of newline on the left side the PIPE, AND, OR. In these cases, it is considered as invalid."
